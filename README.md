Example project for a web app performing CRUD operations into the northwind
database demo for MySQL and a desktop client made in JavaFX for processing
customer orders.

## Northwind Database

Get the Northwind database demo for MySQL
from [https://github.com/dalers/mywind](https://github.com/dalers/mywind).

Notice that this database is a really simple and poor-designed schema so the
system implementation is quite limited by that constraint.

## Northwind System

This project consists of a PHP back-end serving the CRUD API to work with the
given database
(Northwind), and two clients; one is a web app for the admin to manage the
system, and the other is a desktop app for the employee (cashier) to take the
customer orders.
